You can run the "get-the-patches.bat" script in the "patches" folder to automatically 
download the patches. You'll need cURL installed for this method to work. If you're 
on Windows 10/11 you should have cURL installed by default. To vrify, open CMD and 
enter "curl -V" uppercase V. If you get a verion number then you have cURL installed. 
If you get a "'curl' is not recognized as an internal or external command..." you don't 
have cURL installed. You can follow this guide to install cURL:
